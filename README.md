# Auto-Typer-for-Type-racer-and-Human-benchmark-
This is a Python script that uses the libraries, Selenium and Pyautogui it terms of how they work the Pyautogui function could work on other typing programs/ tests other than human benchmark but human benchmark is what I've mainly tested on.

This also will only work on windows for max and linuz your going to have to install the modules another way that I dont know how to do.

Finally if you do use my terrible code for some reason well thank you.
